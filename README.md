## 🛡️ Project 1: Password Strength Checker (Cybersecurity)

### Description
This project analyzes the strength of a user-entered password based on common security rules such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  
It also demonstrates password hashing using the SHA-256 algorithm.

### Features
- Password strength evaluation (Weak / Medium / Strong)
- Pattern matching using regular expressions
- Secure password hashing using hashlib

### Concepts Covered
- Authentication security
- Password policies
- Cryptographic hashing

### How to Run
```bash
python password_checker.py
